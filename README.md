## ✔️ Overview   

This game was developed to study Level Design and Unity 2D

The main concept of the game revolves around platformer challenges, with the most unique level being the one with the gravity mechanic.

## 🛠 Tools
The only tools used for this project were Unity and Visual Studio for coding. I utilized pre-existing assets for game development.

If you'd like to review the primary code I've created for this game, you can find it in Assets/Scripts. 

It was my first using Unity Events.
